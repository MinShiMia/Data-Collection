This folder includes the codes showing you how to scrap Reddit posts and comments step by step and do further analytics.

The initial ideas and part of the codes are borrowed from the sharing by urvishmahajan on Geeksforgeeks website (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scraping-reddit-using-python/). Based on the author's sharing, I expanded the code not only by scraping from a single URL link but could from multiple links and storing the results in one single file.

There are mainly four steps to scrap Reddit data as follows:

Step 1: Register Reddit app 

Step 2: Create a PRAW instance to connect to Reddit in Python

Step 3: Manually collect a URL file of the posts related to the topic you want

Step 4: Scrape all the comments for these posts using PRAW 

In this file, "U.S. Job Market" is used to manually collect the URL links and generate a file to import into the scraping program.
